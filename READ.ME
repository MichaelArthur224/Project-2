This data set can be found on kaggle here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
The data set contains information about patients regarding their health
Strokes is the 2nd leading cause in death in the US
One major detail is that people of older age have heart disease and you can see in the graph in the project
I would suggest to focus on preventing heart disease and then focus on the older aged patients
My model showcased the best results using the Dec Tree model
I think the dec tree model could help us prevent strokes and allow us to see the lifestyle our patients live that are more likley to have a stroke
and see how that could play a part in their health.
